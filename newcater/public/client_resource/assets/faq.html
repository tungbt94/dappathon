                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. As this is a part-time program, we do not provide scholarships, stipends, funding or insurance. All costs associated with participating in the program are covered (such as travel and accommodations). </span></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: Which costs does the program cover? &nbsp;</b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acumen covers all program-related expenses during the fellowship year. This includes all costs associated with the seminars including lodging, food, transportation and visas. </span></p>

                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. Acumen’s leadership development programs are completely independent of our investment activities.

                                    <p><b>Q: How is the program structured? </b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fellows remain in their jobs and come together for five seminars, each lasting 6 days, throughout the year. Attendance at each seminar is mandatory. Between seminars, Fellows are expected to participate in and complete online readings and assignments..</span></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: What is the total time commitment required for the program? </b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total in-person time commitment is about 30 days (5 seminars, 6 days each) over the course of the year, plus travel time to the seminar locations. Whenever possible we have scheduled seminars to run from Tuesday to Sunday. </span></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between seminars you will be expected to spend additional time on program-related assignments, email correspondence and collaborative projects for approximately three hours per week. </span></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: What happens during and between the seminars? </b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through five in-person seminars and online content between seminars, Fellows build trust and test new leadership skills within their cohort. This cohort-based model creates deep bonds of trust and fellowship, relationships that persist long beyond the first year and that Fellows utilize to create greater impact. Fellows are equipped with the knowledge, support systems and skills to challenge the status quo, work across lines of difference and mobilize their communities.

                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program has a 100% attendance requirement, and all selected Fellows must attend all program meetings (seminars) and complete assignments between seminars or face possible removal from the program.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: Is internet connectivity a requirement to participate in the program?</b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. The primary method of communication regarding logistics and other important information is email. Assignments between seminars will be provided via an online learning platform. Therefore, all Fellows must have regular and reliable internet access that allows the downloading and uploading of documents as well as audio and video files. </span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: Where will the different seminars and meetings for the program be held?</b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trainings are typically held in or around major cities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>

                                    </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The application process opens on 6th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;August 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and closes at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1:59 PM IST/PKT/EAT (GMT+3) on Sunday 9th September 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All applications must be completed and submitted online by this deadline. It is recommended that you submit your application well in advance of the deadline to avoid any last-minute technical difficulties or connectivity problems.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not accept late submissions.</span></p>
                                    <p>Note: Our new Colombia Fellows program is already<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/1MUsO5Pa84mZ9juH2">&nbsp;receiving early applications</a>.</p>
                                    <p><b>Q: What happens after I submit my application? </b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a total of three stages to the application process. Following the initial submission (stage 1), our selection team will carefully read each application and select the candidates who will move on to stage 2. Stage 2 involves participation in a set of online activities that closely resemble the type of activities you’ll experience during the fellowship. Once again, the selection team will carefully review the submissions from this second stage, and select candidates who will progress to the third and final stage. Finalists will be invited to attend a mandatory day-long in-person interview (called a “Selection Conference”), which will be held in mid-November in each region.</span></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all candidates have been interviewed, the selection team will make a final decision. We expect to extend offers by December 2018. The first seminar of the program will take place in the first quarter of 2019.&nbsp;At each stage of the application process, only successful candidates chosen to advance to the next round will receive communication from our team.</span></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: How many Fellows are selected each year in each region? </b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, we select 20 Fellows per year in each region. </span></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: What are the technology requirements for accessing and completing the application? </b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For stage one and stage two of the application process, applicants will need a stable internet connection. All application documents must be submitted through an online portal. We highly recommend using Google Chrome as your browser. If you experience issues submitting any element of your application, please try submitting your application from a different browser, computer or a different location with stronger internet connectivity.</span></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: What if I have trouble uploading or submitting my application? </b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This typically occurs when JavaScript or Flash is not enabled. If you enable these programs, or download the necessary applications, you should be able to upload your documents without any issue. </span></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: Will I get notified after my application has been submitted? </b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Our system automatically sends a confirmation email once your initial application has been submitted. If you do not receive one immediately after submitting your application, please check your email settings to make sure that our emails are not caught in your spam filter. We will send emails through the following domains: @wizehive.com, @sendgrid.me, and @acumen.org &nbsp;</span></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: What is the word of the day? </b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community</span></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: Are recommendation letters required? </b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we will ask you to provide the contact information of one or two professional references that we can contact if you make it to the third and final stage of the selection process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your references should be people with whom you have worked closely. They should not be family, friends or spouses. </span></p>
                                    <p><b>Q: Can I edit my application after it’s been submitted? </b></p>
                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, this is not possible. Make sure you double check all elements of your application before it is submitted. We cannot accept edits or changes after the fact, either through the platform or by email. </span></p>

                                <p><b>Q: What do Fellows do after completing the program? What type of professional and personal development support does the Acumen Fellows Programs offer? </b></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acumen is invested not only in each Fellows’ growth over the course of the year-long program, but also in their development as lifelong agents of fighting poverty and injustice. After completing the first year, Fellows may receive continued mentorship and coaching. Acumen also has a very active and growing network of social sector organizations, thought leaders, and Fellows across the global. We engage all Acumen Fellows through events, newsletters and subsequent recruitment processes.</span></p>
